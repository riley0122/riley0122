# Hello there!

I'm Riley, or known in real life as Lucas. I am still learning but have quite a bit of experience. I am primarily a web developer, however I also often enjoy using C++ or C#. And of course, can't miss the occasional Python here and there. If you think the code on my profile is a mess, you'd probably right. But I am still studying and am looking to improve :)

Check out my very awesomesauce website: [riley0122.dev](https://riley0122.dev/)

You can contact me on [riley@riley0122.dev](mailto:riley@riley0122.dev)!

## What I'm working on

The biggest project I am currently running is [windesheimMC](https://windesheimMC.online/). It's a minecraft server, where anyone who goes to the Hogeschool Windesheim can join after linking their account to their student number on the website.

So far it has required me to know how to be able to make a website and backend in PHP, wite a (simple) Minecraft Paper plugin in Java, and it also required quite a bit of server orchestration insight for setting up and configuring the servers we use. This project is still ongoing and running. So if you study at Windesheim; don't hesitate to join today! [https://windesheimMC.online/](https://windesheimMC.online/)

## My personal statement on AI

I am a firm believer that AI should be used as little as possible, preferably not at all. Using AI will make you lazy and it will take away from your ability to research and write code yourself. It also isn't the best for the environment. So is skipping 10 minutes of sitting down and typing really worth all that?

Nearly all of the code you will find on my profile was written by me, without help of AI. There may be some rare instances where I have been assisted by AI, however there will never be a piece of code that was entirely written by AI.
