# Hello there!

I'm Riley, or known in real life as Lucas. I am still learning but have quite a bit of experience. I am primarily a web developer, however I also often enjoy using C++ or C#. I am starting my HBO ICT (bachelors) study next year, so I am really excited to finally learn how it's properly done instead of everything being an improvised mangled mess like all of the repositories you will find on my profile (:
